    <p style="text-align: left;">Hello, and welcome to my HTML code! This is about airports. I will be talking about many airports over the span of maybe a couple of weeks(don't know).
    I am talking about certain aeroplanes too, like the Airbus Beluga, and other commercial/industrial planes, everything inbetween.

Now, I will be talking about the Heathrow Airport 
<div style="color: red;">(ICAO: LHR/EGLL),
</div>
as it is the main airport in the U.K. <br/> <br/>
Some stats for the airport:<br/>
RWY 09L/27R length: 3902m/12802ft Material: Grooved Asphalt
<br/>
RWY 09R/27L length: 3660m/12008ft Material: Grooved Asphalt
<br/>
There is inter-terminal transport like a tram, similar to the Dubai Intl', when I went there. These depend, according to the terminal, but this normally is the case. Sometimes, the inter-terminal bus takes you to the other terminal. I will link an airport chart down below, and now will list the Ground Crew providers.
Menzies, British Airways and Dnata are the main ones.

<p> <div style="font-size: 40px; text-align: center;"> 737-8 Max</div>

</p>
<br/>
<br/>
The 737-8 Max is a plane that was grounded for a year, due to a system called the MCAS which would prevent the plane from stalling beacuse the engines were positioned too high on the wing. This caused 2 major crashes within a couple of months, which lead to the airplane being grounded for nearly two years. The aeroplane is flown by some major carriers like: <br/> AirCanada,<br/> Alaska Airlines,<br/> Southwest,<br/> American Airlines, and FlyDubai to name a few. The airplane has came back into service, and has a higher fuel efficiency, which is the reason they made the plane. They were competing with Airbus to make a very fuel efficient plane, Airbus making the A320neo(new engine option) and Boeing, the 737-Max lineup of planes.
