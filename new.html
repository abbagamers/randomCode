    <p>Hello, and welcome to my HTML code! This is about airports. I will be talking about many airports over the span of maybe a couple of weeks(don't know).
    I am talking about certain aeroplanes too, like the Airbus Beluga, and other commercial/industrial planes, everything inbetween.

Now, I will be talking about the Heathrow Airport <div style="color: green;">(IATA/ICAO: LHR/EGLL)</div> , as it is the main airport in the U.K.
