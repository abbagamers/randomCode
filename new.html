<p>I am making a texturepack for Minecraft: Java Edition. It is a Blue/White theme pack, using the Aquamarine and Prismarine Colors, especially accenting Ender Pearls and Swords/Axes<br/>

   <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>This Texture Pack is being developed by me, and this is a new pack, from a new texturepack maker. Special credits to Finlay for helping me make this texturepack, through his youtube videos. His tutorials are very good at showing the ways of making a pack in Minecraft and I recommend everyone that reads this checks him out. He really deserves it. This pack only has Diamond stuff worked on, pearls and a totem too. I am also working with a friend of mine, with the textures. I am starting to work on a GUI for the whole thing.</p>
