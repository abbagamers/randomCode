<p> This nation is called (). <br/>
  The nation has a flag similar to this:

  The Nation is represented by its distinctive banner and shield design. This design is a cross with red, yellow and orange, making them bold colors, showing the nation's power. The nation has it's own armory, and a moat around the main area, which only certain know how to get across.
  The map will be earth and all will have factions, marked on the DynMap(I think.) These factions will be listed below, when people join the server. Now, the Nation is on a private server which runs on my PC, on Java Edition. There will also be Bedrock Edition, but that it later to come, since DynMap doesn't support it. <a href="http://localhost:8123/?worldname=earthmap&mapname=flat&zoom=6&x=6922&y=64&z=5034">The DynMap Link</a>
  The Server that uses DynMap is Java. It is only me and my friend as we are the only ones who have a PC. But the bedrock should have regular posts on YouTube (maybe). <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, there will be different factions. There will be one with 2 girls, (which are my friends) and one with some other friends of mine, who happen to join the server.
